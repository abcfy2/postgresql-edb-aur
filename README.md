# postgresql-edb aur package source code

This is my aur package about Enterprise-Proven Postgres edition by [enterprisedb.com](https://www.enterprisedb.com/enterprise-postgres/edb-postgres-platform) (EDB postgres).

Different branches for different packages. For example: `10` is for `postgresql-10-edb`, `11` is for `postgresql-11-edb`, and so on.

`master` branch is for develop and testing.

Some useful commands:

```bash
# Package locally
makepkg -s

# Package and install locally
makepkg -sif
```
